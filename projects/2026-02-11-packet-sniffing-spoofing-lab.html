        <h1>Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab (Documented)</h1>

        <div class="muted small">
            <strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-11 |
            <strong>Time:</strong> 8:10 PM (America/Chicago)
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Goal (plain language):</strong>
            <div class="muted">Understand how network sniffing works and how spoofing demonstrates security risk, using controlled lab exercises.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>What I did today</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Worked through sniffing concepts</strong> and observed how traffic can be captured under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviewed spoofing behavior</strong> and why trust assumptions on networks can be exploited.</li>
            <li><strong>Practiced writing clear explanations</strong> for what I saw, like reporting an incident or a finding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cybersecurity relevance</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Security Operations Center alignment:</strong> understanding traffic patterns helps with alert triage and investigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk awareness:</strong> spoofing demonstrates why segmentation, encryption, and validation matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> being able to explain “what happened” is as important as running tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Write a short “lab findings” summary that reads like a real incident note.</li>
            <li>Add a follow-up page for the next lab milestone with the new date.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>About me (portfolio context):</strong>
            <div class="muted">
                I am building consistent hands-on proof for entry-level cybersecurity roles by converting labs into short, defendable write-ups.
